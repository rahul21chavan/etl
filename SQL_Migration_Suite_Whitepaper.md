## Introduction

**SQL Migration Suite** is an end-to-end, AI-powered platform for database and ETL modernization. It addresses the critical challenges enterprises face during data platform migrations—ranging from SQL complexity analysis and cross-dialect conversion, to ETL job assessment and automated translation to modern frameworks. The suite leverages advanced AI/ML models, robust UI/UX via Streamlit, and modular design to drive productivity, accuracy, and transparency in migration projects.

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), providing an interactive, easy-to-use web interface.
- **Backend**: Modular Python backend integrating:
  - AI model handlers (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
  - Parsers and analyzers for SQL and ETL artifacts
  - File management and reporting utilities
- **AI/ML Integration**: Offers selection of underlying LLMs for code conversion and optimization.
- **Extensibility**: Each module can be enhanced or swapped independently, supporting new dialects, ETL tools, and frameworks.

---

## Module 1: SQL Complexity Analyzer

### Purpose

Quickly assesses the complexity and migration effort of SQL codebases, enabling accurate project scoping and early risk identification.

### Features

- **Dialect Selection**: Supports Teradata, Oracle, SQL Server, SAP HANA.
- **Bulk Uploads**: Accepts ZIP files containing multiple SQL scripts.
- **Complexity Scoring**: Classifies files into `Simple`, `Medium`, `Complex`, `Very Complex`, or `Unknown` using a rules-based scoring system tailored to each dialect.
- **Effort Estimation**: Estimates migration time based on complexity and object type (Function, Procedure, View, Table).
- **Object Counting**: Counts different SQL object types for inventorying.
- **Insights**: Provides additional observations (e.g., exceptions, patterns) to highlight possible migration blockers.
- **Reporting**: Tabular results displayed interactively; supports export for project documentation.

### Implementation Notes

- **Configurable Weightages**: Each dialect's complexity scoring and effort estimation is defined via external config.
- **File Handling**: Input directories are cleared before each run for deterministic results.
- **Extensible**: New dialects or complexity criteria can be added with minimal code changes.

## Module 2: SQL Conversion

### Purpose

Automates translation of SQL code from legacy databases to modern cloud targets, reducing manual rework and migration errors.

### Features

- **Source & Target Selection**: Supports conversions between Teradata, Oracle, SQL Server, SAP HANA → Databricks, BigQuery, Snowflake.
- **Bulk Processing**: Handles entire SQL codebases via ZIP uploads.
- **AI-driven Translation**: Uses LLMs to perform context-aware, dialect-specific SQL rewrites.
- **Streaming Conversion**: Displays conversion results in real-time for user feedback and transparency.
- **Output Packaging**: Generates a downloadable ZIP file with all converted SQL scripts.

### Implementation Notes

- **Model Selection**: Users choose between different AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to optimize cost or quality.
- **Mapping Support**: Integrates with function/type mapping files for enhanced accuracy.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully skips or flags files that fail conversion.

---

## Module 3: SQL Optimizer

### Purpose

Refines and optimizes SQL queries for performance on the target cloud platform, leveraging AI and vendor best practices.

### Features

- **Target Platform Tuning**: Supports Databricks, BigQuery, Snowflake-specific optimizations.
- **Bulk Optimization**: Users upload multiple SQL files (ZIP); each is optimized in a streaming fashion.
- **AI-Powered Rewriting**: LLMs suggest improvements—index hints, query restructuring, anti-pattern removal, etc.
- **Result Visualization**: Before/after queries are presented for user review.
- **Downloadable Outputs**: Optimized scripts are zipped for convenient download.

### Implementation Notes

- **Isolation by Directory**: Inputs and outputs are managed in distinct directories for safety.
- **Extensible**: New optimization rules or platforms can be added via configuration or additional model endpoints.

---

## Module 4: ETL Complexity Analyzer

### Purpose

Analyzes legacy ETL jobs (Informatica, Datastage) to provide complexity classification, migration effort, and risk factors.

### Features

- **Source Selection**: Informatica (XML exports) and Datastage (XML exports) supported.
- **Bulk Analysis**: ZIP upload for multiple job definitions.
- **Complexity Scoring**: Applies per-job complexity measures based on transformation types, dataflows, and job interdependencies.
- **Effort Estimation**: Assigns migration effort metrics and risk levels.
- **Tabular & CSV Reporting**: Results shown in-browser and available as CSV for project tracking.

### Implementation Notes

- **Parser Extensibility**: New ETL tools can be supported by adding new parsers and scoring logic.
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Files with parsing issues are flagged for manual review.

---

## Module 5: ETL Migration

### Purpose

Automates the conversion of legacy ETL jobs (Informatica, Datastage, Snowflake SQL) to modern platforms (Snowpark PySpark, Snowflake SQL, Matillion, DBT).

### Features

- **Source & Target Selection**: Multiple sources and targets supported, including file type selection (XML, JSON, TXT, SQL, PY).
- **Instruction Customization**: Users can review and edit the LLM prompt that governs the code generation, enabling fine-tuned control.
- **Streaming Migration**: Provides real-time feedback as files are processed and converted.
- **Rich Output**: For targets like DBT, generates multiple files (sources.yml, schema.yml, SQL scripts) per job.
- **Summary Reporting**: Produces CSV summarizing each job's conversion, manual intervention required, and estimated conversion percentage.
- **Bulk Download**: All generated artifacts are zipped for easy download.

### Implementation Notes

- **Prompt Engineering**: Instruction prompts are dynamically generated and user-editable, allowing for adaptation to project-specific needs and evolution of LLM capabilities.
- **Error and Edge Case Handling**: Files that fail to convert or require manual intervention are logged and summarized for escalation.

---

## Security & Best Practices

- **Sandboxed Execution**: All file operations occur in isolated directories with cleanup before each run.
- **No Data Persistence**: Uploaded files and generated outputs are not persisted beyond user session unless downloaded.
- **Configurable API Keys**: Sensitive keys (OpenAI, Azure, etc.) loaded from environment variables, not hardcoded.
- **Session Isolation**: Streamlit session state ensures user-specific prompt editing and file handling.
- **Auditability**: Logs and CSV reports support downstream auditing and compliance.

## Conclusion

SQL Migration Suite empowers organizations to accelerate their data modernization journeys by automating the most labor-intensive and error-prone aspects of SQL and ETL migration. The modular, extensible architecture ensures that the suite remains relevant as new data platforms and migration challenges emerge. By combining the power of advanced AI with robust engineering best practices, SQL Migration Suite maximizes migration efficiency, accuracy, and transparency.
